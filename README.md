This is a module that enables the [Item Piles](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/item-piles) module to work seamlessly with the WFRP4e game system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

## Contents
Module currently only offers the basic WFRP4e configuration for Item Piles.

## Future plans

* Move predefined Merchants and Merchant RollTables from [Forien's Armoury](http://foundryvtt.com/packages/forien-armoury) to this module.

*If you have **any** suggestion or idea on new contents, open an [Issue](https://github.com/Foundry-Workshop/item-piles-wfrp4e/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) or hit me up on Discord!*
